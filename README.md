# GA_DataScience_FinalProject

This repository contains the final project for the data science course at the General Assembly in Chicago. 

Using the Census' County Business Patterns data, the Scenes data, and Geolytics data, I analyze what makes a place have more arts than others, and what kind of traits influenced the increase or decrease of the arts in zip codes. 

For this project, I limited the dataset to 500 observations.
